# Adding alt text

Include alt text with your data visualizations, no matter how you choose to embed them:

1. If you’re rendering ggplot (or other data visualization) code within a .qmd file, add the fig-alt code chunk option:


```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| ## Example of how to include alt-text and caption in a rendered html document.
#| fig-cap: "Figure caption text goes here"
#| fig-alt: "Alt text goes here"
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

2. If you’ve save your data visualization as an image file, you can embed it in a .qmd file using either markdown or html syntax:

### Markdown

![Figure caption goes here](file/path/to/image){fig-alt="Alt text goes here"}

### HTML

<img src="file/path/to/image" alt="Alt text goes here">

## Example #1
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| fig-cap: "Boxplot of penguin flipper lengths"
#| fig-alt: "A boxplot of penguin flipper lengths where Gentoo penguins have flipper lengths that are about 12% larger than Adelie or Chinstrap penguins."

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = species), width = 0.3, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = species), alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE, position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, seed = 0)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Species",
       y = "Flipper length (mm)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Warning message is displaying as well as a regular output message. Let's remove them.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| fig-cap: "Boxplot of penguin flipper lengths"
#| fig-alt: "A boxplot of penguin flipper lengths where Gentoo penguins have flipper lengths that are about 12% larger than Adelie or Chinstrap penguins."

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = species), width = 0.3, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = species), alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE, position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, seed = 0)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Species",
       y = "Flipper length (mm)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| fig-cap: "Histogram of penguin species frequency"
#| fig-alt: "A stacked histogram of penguin body massees per species where Gentoo has the higherst average body mass (in grams) over Adelie and Chinstrap species by x percent/ x grams."


ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, 
                 position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Body mass (g)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Penguin body masses")
```
